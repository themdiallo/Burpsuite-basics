<h1>Burp suite Lab: The Basics</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consist of exploring the basics of Burp Suite to understand how it functions as a web application security testing tool. You'll learn how to use Burp Suite as an intercepting proxy to capture and analyze HTTP/S requests and responses between your browser and the web application. The lab will also cover key features such as Repeater to modify and resend requests, and Intruder to automate testing with custom payloads. Additionally, we will examine how Burp's Scanner can help identify common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), providing practical experience in securing web applications.<br />


<h2>Tools Used within Burp Suite</h2>

- <b>Proxy: Intercepts and inspects HTTP/S traffic between the browser and the web application.
- Repeater: Manually modifies and resends requests to observe responses.
- Intruder: Automates customized payloads for testing various inputs, like brute force attacks or parameter fuzzing.
- Scanner: Automatically scans for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and others.
- Sequencer: Analyzes the randomness of tokens or session IDs to test for predictability.
- Decoder: Encodes and decodes data in various formats (Base64, URL, etc.).
- Comparer: Compares two sets of data, such as HTTP responses, to detect subtle differences.
- Extender: Allows users to add custom extensions or use third-party plugins to extend Burp's functionality.
- Spider: Crawls the target website to discover all its available endpoints and links.
- Logger: Keeps track of all HTTP requests and responses for further analysis./b>
